# Computational Model of Spatial Auditory Attention

This is a Python implementation of a computational model of spatial auditory attention. Spatial attention has been the focus of research in cognitive models, though much of the work has focused on studying visual attention. This model uses the well-established framework of constraint satisfaction problems to model how auditory attention is allocated over space.
